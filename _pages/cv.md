I am a Master’s student in Artificial Intelligence at Rochester Institute of Technology, currently seeking a thesis opportunity for the upcoming academic year. My interests lie in natural language processing, explainable AI, and socially aligned machine learning.

While I do not yet have publications, I have pursued several applied and research-oriented projects—most recently, building a judicial simulation using LLMs to analyze Supreme Court cases, where I explored persona-based reasoning and prompting strategies. My background also includes experience in large-scale data analysis, model development, and system deployment.


Education
------
* **Rochester Institute of Technology, NY, USA, 2026**
  * Pursuing MS in Artificial Intelligence
  * Coursework: Fundamentals of AI/ML, Math Methods for AI, Ethics of AI, Forecasting Methods.
* **IIIT – Hyderabad, Hyderabad, India, 2023**
  * Secured a Post Graduate Certification in Software Engineering for Data Science with Distinction.
  * Coursework: Data Engineering, Machine Learning, Intelligent Systems Design, etc.
* **Indira Gandhi National Open University, Delhi, India, 2020**
  * Graduated with a Bachelor of Computer Applications with First Class.
  * Coursework: Data Structures and Algorithms, Discrete Mathematics, Operating Systems, etc.


Research Interests
------
I’m broadly interested in building AI systems that are socially aligned and interpretable, especially in high-stakes domains like justice and governance.
My current focus areas include:
* Socially Aligned AI – Designing frameworks that integrate fairness, optimization, and behavioral modeling to reduce systemic bias.
* Natural Language Processing & Reasoning with LLMs – Exploring how large language models can emulate nuanced human reasoning and decision-making.
* Multilingual LLMs & AI Translation – Developing inclusive AI systems that support equitable access across languages, and consequently across different demographics.
* Explainable AI – Creating interpretable models to increase transparency and stakeholder trust in machine learning systems.


Professional Experience
------
* **ML Engineer, Kloud9.nyc (Apr 2023 - Jul 2024)**
  * Led Feature Engineering: Completed feature engineering and validation phases for 50+ features of a machine learning
model for ghost inventory prediction at a major variety store chain, achieving 92% accuracy, contributing to 10%
reduction in stock discrepancies.
  * Data Analysis & Model Expansion: Analyzed ~10 datasets with multimillion data points using PySpark and Pandas to
identify key statistical patterns, trends, and anomalies. Enhanced the existing ML model's generalization, resulting in a
15% improvement in prediction stability across diverse store environments.
  * Automation & Efficiency: Implemented a data analysis and insights pipeline to optimize the insights workflow,
decreasing processing time from 3 hours to 20 minutes per batch.
  * Cross-Functional Collaboration: Collaborated with data engineers and business stakeholders to align model objectives
with business goals, streamlining the analysis pipeline and reducing deployment time by ~80%.
  * Training & Mentorship: Trained and mentored 5+ interns in feature engineering, PySpark, and ML best practices,
leading to 3 successful full-time conversions.

* **Software Engineer, WSP Global (Oct 2020 - Apr 2023)**
  * Developed CLI tool using PowerShell and ProjectWise to automate creation and management of employee records.
Utilized by Digital Operations team for induction of ~60K new employees, saving ~2.5 human-months per year.
  * Automated pipeline to detect project archival status using PowerShell, PowerAutomate and SharePoint. Developed a
monthly workflow to notify project-owners and automatically archive projects. Led to 71% reduction in Digital
Operations team's maintenance overhead.
  * Designed and implemented a Python application to maintain integrity in employee and project databases. Employed
Pandas DataFrames to detect duplicates and inconsistencies across ~80,000 employee records per month.

* **Visa Official, Consulate General of France in Bangalore (Mar 2020 - Sep 2020)**
  * Authored 5 analysis reports on Covid-19 (w.r.t economy, education, transport), distributed to the French community
of 3 states (1000+ persons); Also processed ~50 visas per day.

* **Management Intern, Campus France India (May 2018 - Oct 2018)**
  * Counselled and interviewed ~100 students for higher education. Organized 6 education fairs at 10 institutions while
also training interns.

Talks and Presentations
------
* **AI Alignment in Criminal Justice, RIT Graduate Showcase (Apr 2025)**
  * Delivered an oral presentation on AI in Criminal Justice at the RIT Graduate Showcase and awarded 1st place out of ~60 presentations; proposed a novel framework combining optimization and game theory to reduce bias in jury selection and deliberation using demographic weighting and behavioral modeling, with real-world applicability through simulations and tooling.

* **LLM-as-a-SupremeCourt-Judge, RIT Graduate Showcase (Apr 2025)**
  * Presented a poster on the LLM-as-a-SupremeCourt-Judge project at the RIT Graduate Showcase, demonstrating an AI-powered judicial simulation framework using large language models to analyze 200 U.S. Supreme Court cases from the JUSTICE dataset.


Training and Outreach
------
* Trained and mentored 5+ interns in feature engineering, PySpark, and ML best practices, leading to 3 successful full-time conversions.

* Interviewed candidates for French translation positions at WSP, leading to 4 hires. Also conducted ~20 student visa interviews for the French embassy.
