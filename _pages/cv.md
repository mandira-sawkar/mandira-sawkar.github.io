Work experience
------
* **Apr 2023 - Jul 2024: ML Engineer, Kloud9.nyc**
  * Led Feature Engineering: Completed feature engineering and validation phases for 50+ features of a machine learning
model for ghost inventory prediction at a major variety store chain, achieving 92% accuracy, contributing to 10%
reduction in stock discrepancies.
  * Data Analysis & Model Expansion: Analyzed ~10 datasets with multimillion data points using PySpark and Pandas to
identify key statistical patterns, trends, and anomalies. Enhanced the existing ML model's generalization, resulting in a
15% improvement in prediction stability across diverse store environments.
  * Automation & Efficiency: Implemented a data analysis and insights pipeline to optimize the insights workflow,
decreasing processing time from 3 hours to 20 minutes per batch.
  * Cross-Functional Collaboration: Collaborated with data engineers and business stakeholders to align model objectives
with business goals, streamlining the analysis pipeline and reducing deployment time by ~80%.
* Training & Mentorship: Trained and mentored 5+ interns in feature engineering, PySpark, and ML best practices,
leading to 3 successful full-time conversions.

* **Oct 2020 - Apr 2023: Software Engineer, WSP Global**
  * Developed CLI tool using PowerShell and ProjectWise to automate creation and management of employee records.
Utilized by Digital Operations team for induction of ~60K new employees, saving ~2.5 human-months per year.
  * Automated pipeline to detect project archival status using PowerShell, PowerAutomate and SharePoint. Developed a
monthly workflow to notify project-owners and automatically archive projects. Led to 71% reduction in Digital
Operations team's maintenance overhead.
  * Designed and implemented a Python application to maintain integrity in employee and project databases. Employed
Pandas DataFrames to detect duplicates and inconsistencies across ~80,000 employee records per month.

* **Mar 2020 - Sep 2020: Visa Official, Consulate General of France in Bangalore**
  * Authored 5 analysis reports on Covid-19 (w.r.t economy, education, transport), distributed to the French community
of 3 states (1000+ persons); Also processed ~50 visas per day.

* **May 2018 - Oct 2018: Management Intern, Campus France India**
  * Counselled and interviewed ~100 students for higher education. Organized 6 education fairs at 10 institutions while
also training interns.
