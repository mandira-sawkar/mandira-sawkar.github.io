Mandira Sawkar, Leona Joseph, Vivek Senthil

**Description:**
Designed a logic-gated fact-checking system integrating RoBERTa classifiers with contradiction detection, validated on 7,200+ claims. Improved explainability and reliability by maintaining 83% accuracy while enabling selective overrides for low-confidence predictions.

**My contribution:**
Conducted extensive literature review and developed a framework with a fine-tuned DistilRoBERTa with logic-gated overrides; Co-authored an ACM-style conference paper.
